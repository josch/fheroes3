this is still not well tested, so mail me on any problems:

j.schauer@email.de

place your heroes of might and magic complete files in the same directory
as hr.py and extractor.py
 * H3bitmap.lod
 * H3ab_bmp.lod
 * H3sprite.lod
 * H3ab_spr.lod
 * Heroes3.snd
 * H3ab_ahd.snd
 * VIDEO.VID
 * H3ab_ahd.vid

open the commandline and navigate to this directory

python extractor.py

it will find itself the files above and extract them into a new data directory.
the process will take half an hour due to heavy image manipulations which are
very slow in python. The output will be around half a gigabyte.

then place some scenario file in the maps folder and start heroes renaissance
with a command like:

python hr.py "A Viking We Shall Go"
